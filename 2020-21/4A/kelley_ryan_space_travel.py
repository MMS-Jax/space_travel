# Space Travel Simulator, Ryan Kelley, Sept. 28, 2020, 2:36PM, Version 0.3
# ALGORITHM -- Step by step list of instructions to complete a task.

# print instructions
# get user selection
# calculate the distance to the object
# ask how fast you are traveling
# calculate how long it will take (Distance / Speed)
# Check to see if the trip takes more or less than three years.
# If the trip is MORE THAN 3 years, print a warning
# If the trip is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 3 years, print a message of success.


print ("Thank you for using the NASA Space Travel Simulator!")
# print is a METHOD used in Python.  methods are "special abilities" you can use. 


# DECLARING VARIABLES
# variables store DATA.
# Examples of Data include: INTEGERS, FLOATS (decimals), and STRINGS (text).
# Integers are WHOLE NUMBERS, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, including ZERO
# Floats are any POSITIVE or NEGATIVE NUMBER WITH A DECIMAL
# STRINGS are written text. 
# Naming Variables
# camelCase
# snake_case
# Variables in Python can start with _ or a letter, and can contain numbers.
# Variables should BE DESCRIPTIVE.
