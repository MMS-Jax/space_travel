# DECLARING VARIABLES
# “Variables store different types of data.”
# Most Common Data Types are: INTEGERS, FLOATS, STRINGS, and BOOLS.”
# “Integers are positive or negative whole numbers, including zero. Abbreviated as int.”
# “Floats (floating point) are positive or negative numbers that have a decimal. Abbreviated as float.”
# “Strings are lines of text including letters and characters. Abbreviated as str.”
# “Bools (Boolean) are True of False values. Abbreviated as bool.”

# NAMING VARIABLES
# “Variables should ALWAYS be descriptive. Should be able to identify what type of data is stored in the variable.”
# “Examples include: num_eggs, amnt_gas, high_score, or player_name.”
# “Variables in Python can start with _ or a letter but NOT a number.”
# “Variables can use camelCase style or snake_case style but use the SAME style in your code.”
