 Use console.log() to provide a list of options to the user.  One example is provided for you.  The user will select their destination by typing in 
 the number from the list.

/* 
Next we need to have the user select a destination and save that data to a variable. 
Which of the following methods would work best?
    
    var user_choice = input("Type the number of the destination and press the [Enter] key.");
    var user_choice = read_data("Type the number of the destination and press the [Enter] key.");
    var user_choice = data_read("Type the number of the destination and press the [Enter] key.");
    var user_choice = prompt("Type the number of the destination and press the [Enter] key.");

Use your Internet research skills to determine which of the above lines of code would work best.

// REPLACE THIS LINE WITH THE CODE YOU WANT TO USE TO STORE THE USER'S CHOICE.
