# Line 9 is a STATEMENT.  A statement is a complete line of code.
# print is a METHOD.  A method is a "special ability" built in to Python that programmers can use.  


# DECLARING VARIABLES
# Variables allow us to store data.
# The main types of INTEGERS (int), DECIMALS (floats), and STRINGS (string).
# Variable names can be camelCase or snake_case.
# In Python, variable names can start with a letter or an underscore but NOT a number.
# game_1, num_eggs, amnt_gas, or _favorite_flavor are all LEGAL variable names in Python.

light_speed = 299792
# DECLARED light_speed as a variable.  The = sign INITIALIZES the variable, which means giving it a starting value.
print("The speed of light is", light_speed, "Km / s.") 
# When you use a variable_name inside of a string it is called SUBSTITUTION.
